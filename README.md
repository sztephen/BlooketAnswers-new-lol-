This is a blooket hack I made to display correct answers of the question, you can show and hide the display too.
Essentially goes into the Network area, finds the correct answer to the question and displays it in the top right corner.

working as of December 4th 2024 💡

🚨**HOW TO USE 🚨:** Go to the blooket game and open Dev Tools which is just Command+shift+c/inspect. 
Then go to the Network area which you need to find, refresh the blooket page and join the game, have the Network page remaining open.
Now leave Network, copy the code and paste it in Console. 
The code should show a display, and shows the correct answer when questions are there. 
Finally, just close the inspect Dev Tool thingy.
